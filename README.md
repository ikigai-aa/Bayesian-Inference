# Bayesian-Inference
For the final mini-project of the stats unit, we will use the medical charge data we've used for the other mini-projects. Previously, we considered whether we believed that the actual average(non-insured) charge had fallen below a certain threshold.  The hospital is now reviewing its financial resiliency plan, which requires a model for revenue under a range of conditions that include the number of patients treated. Its current model is based on a confidence interval for the mean, and scaling that by different numbers of patients for each scenario. This approach has a number of limitations, most acutely the breakdown of the central limit theorem for low patient volumes; the current model does not do a good job of reflecting the variability in revenue you would see as the number of cases drops. A bootstrap approach would return samples of the same size as the original. Taking subsamples would restrict the sampling to the values already present in the original sample and would not do a good job of representing the actual variability you might see. What is needed is a better model of individual charges.  So the problem here is that we want to model the distribution of individual charges and we also really want to be able to capture our uncertainty about that distribution so we can better capture the range of values we might see. This naturally leads us to a powerful, probabilistic approach â€” we'll use the pymc3 library to perform Bayesian inference.
